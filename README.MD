# GenIds

A node library to **generate unic ids** to create new user id, new colletion id and others. We can use it on any node, especially the help that was developed with typescript!<br/>**by Hubert Ryan!**

## Getting Started🔌

```sh

$ yarn add genids

```

or

```sh

$ npm install genids --save

```

## Getting Started 🧨

A very easy library to use in your node projects. There are two methods for each type of data that will receive identifiers, such as: creating identifiers for **user data** or identifiers for **other types** of data like colletions.

Another option is **createProjectId** which will return you a shorter identifier so as not to confuse users.

To use it with the desired length is quite simple, just call the ** createSpecificLength ** method and insert the string length as a parameter.

> Important: Remembering that the value cannot be less than or equal to 0.
