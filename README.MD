# GenIds

A node library to **generate unic ids** to create new user id, new colletion id and others. We can use it on any node, especially the help that was developed with typescript!<br/>**by Hubert Ryan!**

## Getting StartedðŸ”Œ

```sh

$ yarn add genids

```

or

```sh

$ npm install genids --save

```

## Getting Started ðŸ§¨

A very easy library to use in your node projects. There are two methods for each type of data that will receive identifiers, such as: creating identifiers for **user data** or identifiers for **other types** of data like colletions.

Another option is **createProjectId** which will return you a shorter identifier so as not to confuse users.

But if you want to decide how long the ID is, you can use the **createSpecificLength** method instead.

## Hello ðŸ–¥

Now we can use and develop our project, are we going to test together with me? **Let's Go!**

## Thank You ðŸŽ‰

Thank you so much for reading this repository and seeing my code shares, a huge hug!

Always keep **learning** and **updating**.
